Hey Noah!

Everything looks good.  Just a couple of things to consider:

1) Try to stay up-to-date with the newest Rails paradigms unless you have a good reason not to (a.k.a. use Strong Parameters)
2) Use descriptive controller names (the only one that wasn't descriptive was `MainController`)

Looks good, nice work!
